# CMPSC 600: Senior Thesis Process Updates

This repository manages the process of writing and submitting regular updates for both the benefit of you and your
thesis reader(s). Direct what questions you have to your first reader; should you encounter technical issues with this
repository, file an issue describing the nature of the problem you've encountered.

## Introduction

This assignment requires researchers to write several Markdown documents, stored in the
the `writing` directory. Content contained in these updates may range from reports of progress in your research
process to particularly difficult technical, methodological, or theoretical questions with which you are currently
contending. Posts to the `writing` folder should:

* Contain no fewer than `250` words each
* Be organized into at least two (2) paragraphs
* Use the file-naming convention of `week_#_update.md`

Your first reader may give you various prompts to consider at various points in your process. Other posts will
be more free-form.

### Specific updates

One (1) update, the "Senior Thesis Proposal" update (named on the calendar) has different requirements. For this
update:

* A one-paragraph project summary that explains your research project. 
* A paragraph describing the work that you have already completed. 
* A bulleted list of the steps that you must take to complete the project, followed by
* A one-paragraph description of your plan to achieve them. 

### Evaluation

If your writing meets all of the established
requirements, then you will see a green &#x2714; in the listing of commits in
GitHub. If your submission does not meet the requirements, a red &#x2717; will
appear instead. Your course  instructor will reduce a researcher's grade for
this assignment if the red &#x2717; appears on the last commit in GitHub
immediately before the assignment's due date on August 9, 2022 at 11:59p.

Yet, if the green &#x2714; appears on the last commit in your GitHub
repository, then you satisfied all of the main checks, thereby allowing the
course instructors to further evaluate other aspects of your writing, as described in this assignment sheet.
Unless you provide the course instructors with documentation of the extenuating
circumstances that you are facing, no late work will be considered towards your
grade for this project.
